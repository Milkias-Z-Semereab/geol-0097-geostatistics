## Learning Outcomes

1) Present the main geostatistical techniques, their advantages and their limits.

2) Acquire a mastery of the most commonly used theoretical concepts in geostatistics.

3) Provide the essential bases for understanding expert reports in the environment or in mining and petroleum geology dealing with the estimation of reserves.

4) Master the practical implementation of the techniques.


## Prerequisite knowledge and skills

Probability and Statistics (basic course)


## Assessment methods and criteria

The assessment will include a personal geostatistics project and an oral exam. Each student will receive a set of data for which he will have to carry out the characterization and the spatial modeling using the tools seen during the course. The work will be submitted before the oral exam and will possibly be the subject of additional questions during the oral exam.   

The oral exam will focus on the theoretical principles covered in class. The final mark will be composed of 75% (oral examination) + 25% (personal work) without either of the two ratings being less than 8/20. If the oral exam is < 10/20, only this score will be taken into account.


## Personal Project

See instructions in [personal_project.md`](https://github.com/glouppe/info8010-deep-learning/blob/master/project.md).
