### **Arithmetic with R**

In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. R has the following arithmetic operators:

* Addition: +
* Subtraction: -
* Multiplication: *
* Division: /
* Exponentiation: ^
* Modulo: %%

The last two might need some explaining:
The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9.
The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.

```{r}
# An addition
5 + 5 
# A subtraction
5 - 5 
# A multiplication
3 * 5
 # A division
(5 + 5) / 2 
# Exponentiation
2 ^ 5
# Modulo
28 %% 6
```

### **Variable Assignment**

A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.

A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.

You can assign a value 4 to a variable *my_var* with the command:

```{r}
# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
print (x)

# "=" can also be used as assignment operator
y = 54 

print(y)
```

### **Basic data types in R** 
R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:

* Decimal values like 4.5 are called *numerics*.
* Whole numbers like 4 are called *integers*. Integers are also numerics.
* Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called *logical*.
* Text (or string) values are called *characters*.

```{r}
# create a numeric called  my_numeric with value 42
my_numeric = 42
print(my_numeric)

# create a string called my_character and assign it to be "universe"
my_character = "universe"
print(my_character)

# create a logical variable called my_logical that is FALSE
my_logical = FALSE
print(my_logical)
```
Note: how the quotation marks in the editor indicate that "some text" is a string.

What's that data type? \

If we add 5 + "six", we get an error due to a mismatch in data types. You can avoid such embarrassing situations by checking the data type of a variable beforehand. You can do this with the *class() function*
```{r}
# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
```
### **Vectors** 
Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. \
In R, you create a vector with the combine function c(). You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses. For example:
```{r}
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
print(numeric_vector)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
print(character_vector)
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
print(boolean_vector)
```
You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function. Have a look at this example:
```{r}
some_vector <- c("John Doe", "poker player")
names(some_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")
print(some_vector)
```

Once you have created these vectors in R, you can use them to do calculations.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
